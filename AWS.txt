AWS
==========
Day-1 (Introduction to cloud and why AWS?)
----------
1.What is cloud?
Ans. Cloud computing is a technology that allows us to access and use computing resources like servers,storage, databases and softwares over the internet.Instead of owning physical hardware,we can these services remotely,paying only for what we use.It offers flexibility,scalability and cost savings for businesses and individuals. 

2.Public Vs Private cloud
Ans. In private cloud,it's you and your organization is maintaining and managing the entire cloud platform (or) in simple words organisation but the servers and maintain the data centres.
Scenario:Sectors like banking,if they don't want to expose the data or privacy thet create private cloud.
     In public cloud, cloud providers like amazon,microsoft,google,...are managing the entire data centres.We request resources from them.We have complete control but they are creating the resources for us. Scenario:Startups and midscale organisations just pay the money and use the resources bcz maintaing the servers,datacentres are difficult.

3.Why is public cloud so popular?
Ans. In private cloud,entire setup and maintanance of data centres,servers are difficult and for proper operations they require good knowledge people. It makes more cost to the startups and midscale organizations. That's why most of the organizations are willing to go with public cloud. 

4.Why AWS?
Ans. AWS has the first time advantage. They started the cloud concept and most of the organizations start with AWS and AWS also continuosly working on providing more services,people are liking their services too. AWS large market share also.

5.Trends of people moving back to Private cloud
Ans. Only 1 or 2 percentage of people are moving back to private cloud. The reasons may have security,vulnerability.
 
6.Create an AWS account and get started
Ans. Step1: Go to browser and type create new AWS account
     step2: Give the correct details of yours and complete the process

DAY-2 (IAM)
Discussed topics-[what and why,components,authentication,authorization,root Vs iam Vs sudo users]
----------

7.What is IAM and Why?
Ans. AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service provided by AWS and it helps us to manage access to our AWS resources. IT's like a security system for our AWS account.

IAM allows us to create and manage users,groups and roles.User represent individual people who need access to your AWS resources.Groups are collections of users with similar access requirements, making it easier to manage permissions. Roles are used to grant temporary access to external entities or services.

With IAM, you can control and define permissions through policies. Policies are written in JSON format and specify what actions are allowed or denied on specific AWS resources. These policies can be attached to IAM entities (users, groups, or roles) to grant or restrict access to AWS services and resources.

IAM follows the principle of least privilege, meaning users and entities are given only the necessary permissions required for their tasks, minimizing potential security risks. IAM also provides features like multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security and an audit trail to track user activity and changes to permissions.

By using AWS IAM, you can effectively manage and secure access to your AWS resources, ensuring that only authorized individuals have appropriate permissions and actions are logged for accountability and compliance purposes.

Overall, IAM is an essential component of AWS security, providing granular control over access to your AWS account and resources, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and helping maintain a secure environment.

Components of IAM
Users: IAM users represent individual people or entities (such as applications or services) that interact with your AWS resources. Each user has a unique name and security credentials (password or access keys) used for authentication and access control.

Groups: IAM groups are collections of users with similar access requirements. Instead of managing permissions for each user individually, you can assign permissions to groups, making it easier to manage access control. Users can be added or removed from groups as needed.

Roles: IAM roles are used to grant temporary access to AWS resources. Roles are typically used by applications or services that need to access AWS resources on behalf of users or other services. Roles have associated policies that define the permissions and actions allowed for the role.

Policies: IAM policies are JSON documents that define permissions. Policies specify the actions that can be performed on AWS resources and the resources to which the actions apply. Policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles to control access. IAM provides both AWS managed policies (predefined policies maintained by AWS) and customer managed policies (policies created and managed by you).

8.Authentication Vs Authorization
Ans. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of user.
Ex. When we login into the AWS Management console, AWS veryfies your identity using the credentials you provide.

Authorization: is the process of determing what an authenticated user is allowed to do.Once your identity is authenticated, AWS determines what actions you can perform on which resources based on the permissions assigned. 
Ex. Even after loggin, you might not have access to certain ec2 instances or s3 buckets unless you IAM role permits it.

In AWS, using IAM we do Authentication and authorization.

9.Root User Vs IAM User Vs Sudo User
Ans. Root User: When you first sign up for AWS, root user created. Root user has full access to all AWS services,resources and can perform any action like closing the accound or managing billing etc.

IAM User: Created by the root user with necessary permissions. They don't have any permissions by default. Permissions must be explicitly granted via IAM policies.

Sudo User: is created by an admin on EC2 instance. Suso user can perform administrative tasks on an EC2 instance such as managing users and running commands that require root access.

Among Root, IAM and Sudo users, Root user has first, IAM has second and Sudo user has third privilages.

DAY-3 (EC2)
Discussed topics-[What,why,types,key value pair,region,AZ]
----------
10. What is EC2 instance?
Ans. EC2 is a Elastic Compute Cloud where we are requesting AWS(cloud provider) to give an virtual machine which is elastic in nature(we can scale-up or scale-down the service).

11.why it is required?
Ans. If we create the virtual machine,we need to take care of timely upgrading the servers, security issues and maintaining the servers-up. If we have thousands of servers, to maintain all these things are more cost and management efforts. Instead of this, we request the AWS to give VM. AWS will take care of all those things and we need to pay based on whatever the services and how much time we use them nothing but pay as you go service.
  
12.Types of EC2:
     1.General purpose
     2.Compute optimized
     3.Memory optimized
     4.Storage optimized
     5.Accelerated computing  
   1.General purpose: General Purpose instances are designed to deliver a balance of compute, memory, and network resources. They are suitable for a wide range of applications, including        web servers,small databases, development and test environments, and more.
   2.Compute Optimized: instances provide a higher ratio of compute power to memory. They excel in workloads that require high-performance processing such as batch processing, scientific modeling, gaming servers, and high-performance web servers.
   3.Memory optimized:Memory Optimized instances are designed to handle memory-intensive workloads. They are suitable for applications that require large amounts of memory, such as in-memory databases,real-time big data analytics, and high-performance computing.
   4.Storage optimized:Storage Optimized instances are optimized for applications that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets. They are ideal for tasks like data warehousing, log processing, and distributed file systems.
   5.Accelerated computing :Accelerated Computing Instances typically come with one or more types of accelerators, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs),Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), or custom Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). These accelerators offload computationally intensive tasks from the main CPU, enabling faster and more efficient processing for specific workloads.

13.Purpose of key value pairs
Ans. Key value pair is a combination of public private key to login into that specific instance

14. What is Region, Availability Zone and data centre in AWS?
Ans. A Region is a physical location in the world that consists of three or more Availability Zones.
 An Availability Zone is nothing but where physical data centres are present.
 Data centre is just a building filled with servers.
